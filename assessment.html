    <h2>TEXT</h2>
      <p><strong>There</strong> comes a nice little fluffer. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. It is a lot of fun.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em><strong>You</strong> can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here.</em></p>
    </blockquote>

      <p><strong>If</strong> you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. You're meant to have fun in life. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</p>
